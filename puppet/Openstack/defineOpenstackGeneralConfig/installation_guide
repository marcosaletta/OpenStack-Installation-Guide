Basic step to define the general parameters for your Openstack Deployment

1. Log on into your puppet master host

2. Copy the file common.yaml on this repo into the /etc/puppet/hieradata/ directory.
   cd /etc/puppet/hieradata/
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pon-prisma/OpenStack-Installation-Guide/master/puppet/Openstack/defineOpenstackGeneralConfig/common.yaml

3. Edit the file and customize it in order to fit your environment.
 - change the passowrd. By default the same passowrd will be used for all the services
 - define your public network for outgoing traffic
 - define a private network which will be created during the Openstack deployment for testing
