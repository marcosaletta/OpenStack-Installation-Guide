Basic step to define the general parameter for your Openstack Deployment

1. Log on into your puppet master host

2. Download the file puppet/Openstack/common.yaml file on this repo into the /etc/puppet/hieradata/ directory on the puppet master host.

3. Edit the file and customize it in order to fit your environment.
 - change the passowrd. By default the same passowrd will be used for all the services
 - define your public network for outgoing traffic
 - define a private network which will be created during the Openstack deployment for testing
